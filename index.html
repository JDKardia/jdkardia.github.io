            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Joe Kardia, a Software Engineer currently based out of Chicago!</p>
            <p>I've been in industry since early 2018, working on everything from healthcare, to covid testing, to warehouse analytics, to system infrastructure. I've worked places like Stripe, Anthropic, and several smaller startups.</p>
            <p>I generally prefer working on the backend since that's where most of my experience is focused, but I'm a generalist and am willing to do whatever needs doing to get things done.</p>
            <p>That said, I care deeply about what my work goes towards. My ideals are central to who I am, so I have to believe in the work I'm doing in order to really put my back into it.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I revel in the analog! From collecting stationery to woodworking to reading books, I ground myself in the physical. I'm a big fan of bicycles, both working on them and riding them, cooking, and most genres of music as well.</p>
